## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As an interested visitor, I want to read information about the hemera academy on the public website
and view available courses so that I can choose a suitable course and start a booking.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given I am on the public academy area, When I open the course overview, Then I see a list of
   current courses with title, short description, duration/scope, start date(s) or availability, and
   a clear call to action to book.
2. Given a course has multiple upcoming dates or variants, When I open the course, Then I see a
   details page with full description, learning objectives, target audience, prerequisites, and a
   booking CTA.
3. Given I click ‚ÄúBook now‚Äù for a course, When I am redirected to the booking, Then a clear booking
   process begins (at least selecting date/variant and starting the booking request).

### Edge Cases

- No courses available: An empty state message is shown with a next best alternative.
- Course sold out: Label ‚Äúsold out‚Äù and no direct booking CTA; potentially a waitlist [NEEDS
  CLARIFICATION: Is a waitlist desired?]
- Multiple languages/regions: Content and currency/prices vary [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is localization
  required?]
- External booking flow: CTA leads to an external platform [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Internal vs.
  external booking?]

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: The system MUST provide a public academy information area (overview, mission,
  contact/FAQ).
- FR-002: The system MUST display a public course list including at least title, short description,
  duration/scope, and availability/start date(s).
- FR-003: The system MUST provide a course details view with full description, learning objectives,
  target audience, prerequisites, dates/variants, and a booking CTA.
- FR-004: The system MUST display an appropriate empty state when no courses are available or only
  sold-out courses exist.
- FR-005: The system MUST provide a booking CTA that initiates a booking process (internal or
  external flow).
- FR-006: The system MUST clearly indicate when a course is sold out and prevent booking
  accordingly.
- FR-007: The system SHOULD offer a selectable option (e.g., date selection) for courses with
  multiple dates/variants before starting the booking.
- FR-008: The system SHOULD provide search/filter options for the course list (e.g., category,
  level, date, location/online) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which filters are prioritized?]
- FR-009: The system SHOULD cover basic SEO content for the academy and course pages (title, meta
  description, human-readable URLs, structured data) without technical specification.
- FR-010: The system MUST consider basic accessibility (readable labels, keyboard navigation,
  contrasts).
- FR-011: The system SHOULD clearly represent course availability (e.g., ‚Äúseats available‚Äù, ‚Äúfew
  seats‚Äù, ‚Äúsold out‚Äù); source of availability data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
- FR-012: The system SHOULD display prices if available, including currency and tax notice [NEEDS
  CLARIFICATION: Show prices publicly? Gross/Net?]

### Key Entities
