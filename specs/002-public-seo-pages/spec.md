## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on WHAT and WHY (business value), not HOW
- Keep scope limited to public, SEO-relevant content
- Non-public areas are explicitly out of scope here

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As a visitor, I can discover the site via search engines and view public pages (e.g., landing and course list) with fast loading and rich previews.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given public pages are deployed, when a crawler indexes them, then meta/OG and structured data are present and valid.
2. Given a user lands on a public page, when content is rendered, then it is served via SSG/ISR with a defined revalidate time.
3. Given the site structure, when robots and sitemap are requested, then they are served correctly and reflect public routes.

### Edge Cases

- Missing or sparse data for listings → graceful fallbacks and consistent meta.
- Overly frequent revalidation causing rate limits → tuned revalidate values.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: System MUST provide a public landing page with SSG.
- FR-002: System MUST provide a public course list page with ISR and defined revalidate.
- FR-003: System MUST include SEO meta, Open Graph, and structured data (JSON-LD) where applicable.
- FR-004: System MUST expose sitemap and robots for public pages.
- FR-005: System MUST avoid leaking non-public paths in sitemap/metadata.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-001: Lighthouse SEO score ≥ 90 for public pages.
- NFR-002: Core Web Vitals inline with best practices for SSG/ISR pages.

### Key Entities

- None required initially; pages may consume existing summaries or mock data.
