# Implementation Plan: 006-observability-monitoring-baseline

**Branch**: `006-observability-monitoring-baseline` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: `./spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-observability-monitoring-baseline/spec.md`

> Note â€“ Documentation Quality Gates apply. See repo CI for Markdown, spelling, and link checks.

## Summary

Introduce an observability baseline: Rollbar error tracking (conditionally enabled), structured
logging, and request correlation via `x-request-id`. Keep vendor-specific code encapsulated behind
light wrappers.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js (App Router), `rollbar` (server/browser SDK)  
**Runtime**: Node for middleware and server SDK  
**Testing**: Unit for logger; integration for request-id propagation; manual verification for Sentry
in non-prod sandbox  
**Target Platform**: Vercel

## Rendering Strategy Impact

None. Logging and telemetry are orthogonal to rendering strategy; ensure no SSR is introduced where
not needed.

## Design Notes

- Provide a small `lib/observability` module with a `logger` and `withRequestContext` helpers.
- Initialize Rollbar only when env vars are present (server and browser), sampling via env.
- Use middleware to set/propagate `x-request-id` if missing.
- Attach `requestId` to logs and Sentry scope (tag) when available.
- Provide a minimal Web Vitals handler exporting to console or a no-op by default.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

- Validate Next.js App Router + Rollbar integration patterns (server and client).
- Evaluate request-id generation and safe propagation strategy.
- Define env var contract and sampling defaults.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

- Define `logger` interface and JSON schema.
- Define `getRequestId` helper and middleware interaction.
- Define Rollbar init wrapper API surface for future portability.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

- TDD for logger JSON shape; integration test for header propagation; feature flags for Rollbar.

## Branching & CI Gates

- Follow branch naming; keep docs gates green (Markdown, spelling, link check).
- No external calls during CI unless explicitly allowed; Sentry disabled by default.

## Existing Implementation Inventory (to consider)

The repository already contains a substantial part of this baseline. New work must extend or
integrate with these modules rather than duplicating them:

- Rollbar integration wrappers and helpers:
  - `lib/monitoring/rollbar.ts`
  - `lib/monitoring/rollbar-official.ts`
  - `components/monitoring/DeploymentMonitoringDashboard.tsx`
- Request correlation and middleware:
  - `lib/utils/request-id.ts`
  - `middleware.ts` (propagates/sets `x-request-id`)
  - `lib/monitoring/instrumentation.ts`
- Deployment monitoring endpoints and docs:
  - `app/api/health/deployment/route.ts`
  - `docs/monitoring/deployment-monitoring-setup.md`
- Logging and analytics building blocks:
  - `lib/analytics/request-analytics.ts`
  - `lib/utils/api-logger.ts` (existing logger utilities)

Where applicable, the 006 tasks should reuse and evolve these artifacts, keeping the public APIs
stable and avoiding breaking changes.

## Deltas and next steps

- Confirm Rollbar env-gating across server and client wrappers (no telemetry by default in CI/dev).
- Add a lightweight integration test for "Rollbar disabled" behavior to ensure zero external calls.
- Optionally add a Web Vitals export hook gated behind env (no-op by default) if not already
  present.
