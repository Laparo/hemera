# Feature Specification: Protected Area Shell

**Feature Branch**: `003-protected-area-shell`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Define initial protected shell pages, layout, and navigation scope

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As an authenticated user, I can access a protected app shell with consistent layout and navigation.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given the app is deployed, when I sign in and visit the protected root, then I see a layout with navigation and my session context.
2. Given I open a protected subpage, when the route loads, then server-side auth is checked and the page renders on Node runtime.
3. Given I sign out, when I revisit protected routes, then I am redirected to sign-in.

### Edge Cases

- Flash of unauthenticated content, hydration mismatches, runtime misconfigurations.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: System MUST offer a protected layout and navigation.
- FR-002: System MUST perform server-side auth checks using NextAuth.
- FR-003: System MUST render protected routes with SSR on Node runtime.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-001: No visible flicker/FOUC on hydration.
- NFR-002: Minimal TTFB consistent with SSR requirements.
