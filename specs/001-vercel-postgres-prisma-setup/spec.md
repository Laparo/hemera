# Feature Specification: Vercel Postgres + Prisma + NextAuth + MUI Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-vercel-postgres-prisma-setup`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Configure Vercel Next.js & Prisma Postgres NextAuth per guideline; install dependencies; enable MUI; prepare PR previews"

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no code-level details)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- Mandatory sections must be completed
- Optional sections only when relevant
- Remove non-applicable sections

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01

- Q: Which session strategy shall be used for authentication? ‚Üí A: JWT sessions (stateless)

- Q: How should PR‚Äëpreview deployments handle the database? ‚Üí A: Ephemeral DB per PR (clone/branch, auto tear‚Äëdown)

- Q: Which database connection strategy on Vercel? ‚Üí A: Direct connection to Neon with pooled connection string (connection pooling)

- Q: Who may sign in? ‚Üí A: Open signup: any user (no restriction)

- Q: Which auth providers should be active at start? ‚Üí A: Email, Google, Apple, Instagram

Applied changes:
- Functional Requirements: add explicit criterion for JWT session strategy; no database sessions in MVP.
- Key Entities: Session entity not used initially (JWT strategy).
- Functional Requirements: PR previews must use an ephemeral database per PR; run migrations/seed; auto tear‚Äëdown on merge/close.
- Non-functional: Use Neon pooled connection string for Prisma on Vercel; no self-managed PgBouncer; Prisma Accelerate optional later if needed.
- Functional Requirements: Open signup policy; no org/domain restriction.
- Functional Requirements: Supported providers are Email, Google, Apple, and Instagram (note: some providers may not return email; user linking must rely on providerAccountId).

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As a user, I can sign in securely to the app and access a protected page. As a developer, I can deploy the app to Vercel with a managed Postgres database and have migrations/seed ready for CI/CD.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given the app is deployed, When I visit the sign-in flow, Then I can authenticate via a supported provider (Email, Google, Apple, Instagram) and reach a protected page.
2. Given a fresh environment, When CI runs, Then database migrations run successfully against the configured Postgres instance.
3. Given the UI loads, When I browse components, Then the UI follows Material Design (theme, baseline, accessible patterns).
4. Given a PR preview is created, When the deployment runs, Then an ephemeral database for that PR is provisioned, migrations/seed run, and the database is torn down on PR close/merge.
5. Given any user with a supported provider, When the user attempts to sign in, Then access is granted (no org/domain restriction) and the protected page is reachable.
6. Given a supported provider (Email, Google, Apple, Instagram), When I complete the provider sign‚Äëin, Then the system creates/links my account and grants access to the protected page.
7. Given a protected route, When an unauthenticated user visits it, Then the user is redirected to the sign‚Äëin page (no data leakage).
8. Given an email magic link is invalid or expired, When the user follows it, Then a clear error is shown and the user can request a new link.
9. Given a provider that may not return email (e.g., Apple/Instagram), When the user signs in, Then the account is created/linked via (provider, providerAccountId) without duplicate user records.
10. Given a PR is closed or merged, When the tear‚Äëdown job runs, Then the PR‚Äëscoped database is removed and the removal is verifiable via logs/events.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if OAuth provider fails or user denies consent? ‚Üí Show friendly error and retry.
- How does the system handle missing DB env variables? ‚Üí Show configuration error and fail fast.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: System MUST provide user authentication with a supported provider and a protected page.
- FR-002: System MUST persist auth-related data in a managed Postgres database.
- FR-003: System MUST run schema migrations during deployment.
- FR-004: System MUST render UI using Material Design components and theming.
- FR-005: System MUST support preview deployments for pull requests.

- FR-006: System MUST authenticate users via supported providers (Email, Google, Apple, Instagram). If a provider does not return an email, the account MUST be keyed and linkable via (provider, providerAccountId) without duplicate user records.
- FR-006a: Session strategy MUST be JWT (stateless); no database sessions in MVP.
- FR-007: System MUST retain user data for [DEFERRED: retention policy to be defined post MVP].
- FR-007: Out of Scope (MVP): Data retention policy will be defined post-MVP. No implementation required in this feature; documentation-only note for future work.

- FR-005a: Preview deployments MUST use an ephemeral database per PR, run migrations/seed on deploy, and auto tear‚Äëdown on PR close/merge.

- FR-008: Database connections on Vercel MUST use Neon pooled connection string (connection pooling). Local dev MAY use direct connection.

<!-- FR-006b merged into FR-006 to avoid duplication. -->

- FR-009: Signup MUST be open to any user; no organization or email domain restrictions.

### Key Entities

- User: Represents an authenticated person (basic profile fields)
- Account: Linked OAuth account metadata
- Session: Session tracking (not used initially; JWT strategy)
- VerificationToken: Token for email-based flows (used initially; required for Email magic link)

## Architecture & Structure (High-level)

- Single Next.js application using the App Router. Public content is SEO-friendly (SSG/ISR); protected areas render server-side.
- Server-only concerns (authentication, database access via Prisma) execute on the Node runtime.
- Authentication uses JWT sessions (stateless). No database Session storage; account linking relies on (provider, providerAccountId).
- Data layer: PostgreSQL (Neon/Vercel Postgres) accessed through Prisma. Vercel deploys use a pooled connection string; local development may use a direct connection.
- Preview deployments provision an ephemeral database per pull request, run migrations/seed on deploy, and tear it down on PR close/merge.
- No new public business API is introduced by this feature; only minimal operational endpoints (e.g., health) and authentication flows.
