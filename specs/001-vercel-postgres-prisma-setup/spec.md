**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Configure Vercel Next.js & Prisma Postgres NextAuth per guideline; install dependencies; enable MUI; prepare PR previews"

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no code-level details)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- Mandatory sections must be completed
- Optional sections only when relevant
- Remove non-applicable sections

---

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As a user, I can sign in securely to the app and access a protected page. As a developer, I can deploy the app to Vercel with a managed Postgres database and have migrations/seed ready for CI/CD.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given the app is deployed, When I visit the sign-in flow, Then I can authenticate via GitHub and reach a protected page.
2. Given a fresh environment, When CI runs, Then database migrations run successfully against the configured Postgres instance.
3. Given the UI loads, When I browse components, Then the UI follows Material Design (theme, baseline, accessible patterns).

### Edge Cases

- What happens if OAuth provider fails or user denies consent? ‚Üí Show friendly error and retry.
- How does the system handle missing DB env variables? ‚Üí Show configuration error and fail fast.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: System MUST provide user authentication with a third-party provider (GitHub) and a protected page.
- FR-002: System MUST persist auth-related data in a managed Postgres database.
- FR-003: System MUST run schema migrations during deployment.
- FR-004: System MUST render UI using Material Design components and theming.
- FR-005: System MUST support preview deployments for pull requests.

- FR-006: System MUST authenticate users via [GitHub OAuth].
- FR-007: System MUST retain user data for [DEFERRED: retention policy to be defined post MVP].

### Key Entities

- User: Represents an authenticated person (basic profile fields)
- Account: Linked OAuth account metadata
- Session: Session tracking (if database sessions used)
- VerificationToken: Token for email-based flows (not used initially)
