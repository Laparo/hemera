## Summary

Complete booking and payment system with Stripe integration: authenticated users can book courses,
process payments via Stripe Checkout, and view booking status. Follows Vercel's Stripe integration
guidelines with webhook-based payment confirmation.tation Plan: 004-bookings-basics

**Branch**: `004-bookings-basics` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: `./spec.md` **Input**: Feature
specification from `/specs/004-bookings-basics/spec.md`

## Summary

Introduce minimal bookings capability in the protected area: create a booking and list user’s
bookings. Respect Node runtime (Prisma/NextAuth), SSR for non-public, and domain segmentation
(noindex).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14 (App Router), Clerk Auth, Prisma Client, Stripe,
@mui/material  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (Prisma) with payment tracking  
**Identity**: Clerk Authentication with protected middleware  
**Payment Processing**: Stripe Checkout with webhooks  
**Testing**: Playwright E2E + Unit tests  
**Target Platform**: Vercel (Node runtime for protected area)  
**Project Type**: web (Next.js app with payment integration)  
**Performance Goals**: <2s payment redirect, <500ms booking list  
**Constraints**: PCI compliance via Stripe, webhook reliability  
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user booking system with payment processing

## Constitution Check

PASS (v1.1.0):

- ✅ Non-public routes use Node SSR with Clerk middleware protection
- ✅ Payment processing via Stripe (PCI compliant, no local card storage)
- ✅ Test-first development with E2E payment flow testing
- ✅ Prisma migrations for booking and payment tracking
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode with proper error handling
- ✅ Performance testing for payment flows required
- ✅ Security-first approach with webhook validation

## Rendering Strategy Matrix

| Route                        | Strategy | Revalidate | Runtime | SEO Critical |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---------: | ------- | ------------ |
| /protected/courses           | SSR      |          - | node    | No           |
| /protected/courses/[id]/book | SSR      |          - | node    | No           |
| /protected/bookings          | SSR      |          - | node    | No           |
| /protected/payment/success   | SSR      |          - | node    | No           |
| /protected/payment/cancel    | SSR      |          - | node    | No           |
| /api/stripe/checkout         | API      |          - | node    | No           |
| /api/stripe/webhook          | API      |          - | node    | No           |

Notes:

- Use Clerk server-side authentication checks for all protected routes
- Stripe API routes require webhook signature validation
- Apply noindex headers/meta for protected pages
- Webhook endpoint must handle idempotency for payment events

## Phase 0: Research & Analysis ✅

**Completed:** Stripe integration research, payment flow design, webhook strategy

- ✅ Defined Stripe Checkout integration approach using Vercel template
- ✅ Selected webhook events (checkout.session.completed) for payment confirmation
- ✅ Determined manual retry strategy for payment failures
- ✅ Clarified course data source (admin interface, outside scope)
- ✅ Established environment strategy (Test mode → Production mode)

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✅

**Completed:** Data models, API contracts, development guides

- ✅ **Data Model**: Complete Prisma schema with Course, Booking, PaymentStatus entities
- ✅ **API Contracts**: Comprehensive REST API specification with error handling
- ✅ **Quickstart Guide**: Complete development setup and testing procedures
- ✅ **Database Design**: Migration strategy and sample data structure
- ✅ **Security Model**: Authentication flows and data protection strategies

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

**Strategy:** Test-driven development with comprehensive payment flow coverage

### Task Generation Methodology

1. **Tests First (Constitutional Requirement):**
   - Unit tests for Course and Booking models with validation
   - E2E tests for complete payment flows (success, failure, retry)
   - Stripe webhook processing tests with signature validation
   - API contract validation tests

2. **Implementation Phases:**
   - **Phase 1**: Core data models (Course, Booking) with Prisma migrations
   - **Phase 2**: Stripe setup (API keys, webhook configuration, test environment)
   - **Phase 3**: Payment flow implementation (UI, API routes, webhook handling)
   - **Phase 4**: Security and error handling (validation, rate limiting, monitoring)

3. **Quality Gates:**
   - All tests must pass before implementation proceeds
   - Stripe test mode validation before production configuration
   - Security review for webhook signature validation
   - Performance testing for payment flow latency

### Implementation Sequence

Tasks will be structured to follow constitutional TDD requirements:

1. Write failing tests that define expected behavior
2. Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refactor and optimize while maintaining test coverage
4. Document and validate against acceptance criteria

**Next Command:** `/tasks` - Generate detailed task breakdown

## Branching & CI Gates

- Follow branch naming; ensure docs gates pass and migrations run via `prisma migrate deploy` on
  deploy.
