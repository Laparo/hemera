# Tasks: Booking and Payment System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-bookings-basics/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api.md

Branch: `feature/004-bookings-basics`  
Scope: Complete booking and payment system with Stripe integration; Node SSR; Prisma with payment
tracking.  
Note: Tests first; respect Node runtime for Prisma/Clerk; secure payment handling.

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. ✅ Load plan.md - Tech stack: Next.js 14, Clerk, Stripe, Prisma, MUI
2. ✅ Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Course, Booking, PaymentStatus entities
   → contracts/api.md: 7 API endpoints with authentication
   → research.md: Stripe integration decisions and manual retry strategy
3. ✅ Generate tasks by category: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
4. ✅ Apply TDD rules: Tests before implementation, parallel where possible
5. ✅ Number tasks sequentially with dependencies
6. ✅ Create parallel execution examples
7. ✅ Task completeness validated
```

# Wait for completion
wait
```

### Phase 3.4 - UI implementation (all parallel)

## Dependencies & Critical Path

### Critical Dependencies

1. **T001-T004** (Setup) → Must complete before any implementation
2. **T002-T003** (Schema/Migration) → Required for all database operations
3. **T005-T014** (Tests) → Must pass before implementing corresponding features
4. **T015-T016** (Repositories) → Required for API routes
5. **T017-T018** (Stripe) → Required for payment routes

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 3.2**: All tests can run simultaneously (11 parallel tasks)
- **Phase 3.3**: Stripe services and API routes (6 parallel tasks)
