<!-- Next.js Learning Platform with Clerk Authentication -->

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Test-Driven Development is mandatory for all features and components:

- **Contract Tests First**: All new features must start with failing contract tests that define
  expected behavior
- **Unit Tests Required**: Every component, utility, and service must have comprehensive unit tests
- **TDD Cycle**: Red (failing tests) → Green (minimal implementation) → Refactor → Repeat
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths, 90% for authentication and
  payment flows
- **Payment Testing**: All Stripe integration must use test mode for development with mock payment
  scenarios
- **Prettier Tests**: Code formatting tests ensure consistent style across the entire codebase

### II. Code Quality & Formatting

Consistent code quality and formatting standards are enforced:

- **Prettier Integration**: All code must pass Prettier formatting checks before commit
- **ESLint Compliance**: Zero warnings policy for production code
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated formatting and linting on every commit via Husky
- **CI/CD Gates**: GitHub Actions workflows block merges for formatting violations
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full type safety with strict TypeScript configuration

### III. Feature Development Workflow

Every feature follows a structured development process:

- **Specification First**: Features start with detailed specifications in `specs/` directory
- **Contract Definition**: API contracts and component interfaces defined before implementation
- **Payment Integration**: All payment flows integrate with Stripe using secure webhook handling
- **Authentication Integration**: All protected features integrate with Clerk authentication system
- **Database Migration**: Schema changes require proper Prisma migrations with rollback strategy
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for user-facing features, especially authentication and
  payment flows
- **Payment Security Testing**: Stripe webhook validation and secure checkout flow testing
- **Error Monitoring Integration**: Rollbar error tracking configured for development and production
  environments

### VI. Holistic Error Handling & Observability

Comprehensive error management across the entire application lifecycle with proactive monitoring,
graceful degradation, and user-centric recovery strategies:

#### Error Prevention & Detection

- **Rollbar Integration**: Mandatory error tracking for all production applications with official
  Next.js patterns
- **Mandatory Rollbar Error Logging**: All error logging MUST use Rollbar instead of console.error
  - Use `serverInstance.error()` from `@/lib/monitoring/rollbar-official` for all server-side errors
  - Include structured context data (userId, requestId, timestamp, error details)
  - Replace all `console.error` statements with appropriate Rollbar logging calls
  - Maintain error severity levels (critical, error, warning, info, debug)
- **Client-Side Monitoring**: React Error Boundaries with `useRollbar` hooks capture component
  errors
- **Server-Side Tracking**: All API routes, middleware, and server functions report to Rollbar
- **Global Error Handlers**: App Router `error.tsx` and `global-error.tsx` for comprehensive
  coverage
- **Instrumentation**: Next.js `instrumentation.ts` for uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track critical user flows, Core Web Vitals, and performance
  bottlenecks
- **TypeScript Guards**: Strict type checking prevents runtime errors at compile time
- **Validation Layers**: Zod schemas for API input/output validation with detailed error messages

#### Error Classification & Response

- **Severity Levels**: Critical (system down), Error (feature broken), Warning (degraded), Info
  (tracking)
- **Error Categories**: Authentication, Payment, Database, Network, Validation, Security,
  Performance
- **User-Facing Errors**: Meaningful error messages with actionable recovery steps
- **Silent Monitoring**: Background errors logged without disrupting user experience
- **Cascade Prevention**: Circuit breakers prevent error propagation across services
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms when external services are unavailable

#### Recovery & User Experience

- **Error Boundaries**: Isolate component failures with recovery options (retry, refresh, fallback
  UI)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works even when advanced features fail
- **Offline Resilience**: Service workers cache critical assets and provide offline experiences
- **User Feedback Loops**: Error reporting mechanisms with user context and reproduction steps
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures (network, rate limits)
- **Maintenance Mode**: Graceful handling of planned downtime with informative messaging

#### Monitoring & Alerting

- **Real-Time Alerts**: Immediate notifications for critical errors affecting user experience
- **Trend Analysis**: Error rate monitoring and anomaly detection across time periods
- **Environment Separation**: Isolated Rollbar projects for development, staging, and production
- **Dashboard Visibility**: Error metrics integrated into development and operations dashboards
- **Escalation Procedures**: Automated escalation paths based on error severity and impact
- **Post-Incident Reviews**: Structured analysis of major incidents with prevention planning

#### Privacy & Security

- **Data Privacy**: PII, tokens, and sensitive data filtered from all error reports
- **Security Incident Tracking**: Enhanced monitoring for authentication failures and breaches
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of security-related events and error responses
- **Access Controls**: Restricted access to error monitoring data based on team roles
- **Compliance**: Error handling aligned with GDPR, CCPA, and industry security standards

### Deployment Standards

All deployments follow a structured CI/CD pipeline with mandatory quality gates and exclusive GitHub
Actions enforcement:

- **GitHub Workflow Mandate**: ALL deployments (preview and production) MUST be executed exclusively
  through GitHub Actions workflows - manual deployments via CLI are strictly prohibited
- **No Manual Deployments**: Direct use of `vercel --prod`, `npm run deploy`, or any manual
  deployment commands is forbidden
- **Workflow-Only Access**: Production environment access is restricted to GitHub Actions workflows
  with proper authentication tokens
- **Quality Gates**: Every deployment must pass TypeScript compilation, Prettier formatting, ESLint
  validation, unit tests, and build verification through automated pipelines
- **Preview Deployments**: All pull requests automatically deploy to Vercel preview environments
  with unique URLs via GitHub Actions
- **Production Deployment**: Only `main` branch pushes trigger production deployments to Vercel
  through GitHub Actions workflows
- **Post-Deployment Testing**: E2E tests run against production environment after successful
  deployment via automated workflows

  with incident documentation
- **Environment Secrets**: All sensitive configuration managed through Vercel environment variables
  and GitHub secrets within workflow context
- **Payment Configuration**: Stripe keys (test/live) managed securely with environment-based mode
  switching through GitHub Actions secrets
- **Deployment Audit Trail**: All deployments must be traceable through GitHub Actions logs with
  proper commit SHA tracking

### GitHub Actions Workflow Requirements

The deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) enforces constitutional compliance and is
the EXCLUSIVE deployment mechanism:

- **Sole Deployment Authority**: GitHub Actions is the only authorized method for all deployments -
  no exceptions for manual CLI deployments
- **Multi-Stage Pipeline**: Separate jobs for quality gates, preview deployment, production
  deployment, and E2E validation
- **Dependency Chain**: Production deployment only occurs after all quality gates pass in automated
  sequence
- **Access Control**: Deployment tokens and secrets are exclusively available to GitHub Actions
  runners
- **Automated PR Comments**: Preview deployment URLs automatically posted to pull request comments
  through workflow automation
- **Artifact Management**: Playwright reports uploaded for debugging failed E2E tests via workflow
  artifacts
- **Security**: VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, and VERCEL_PROJECT_ID managed as GitHub repository
  secrets with workflow-only access
- **Payment Security**: Stripe webhook secrets and API keys secured in repository secrets with
  proper test/live separation and workflow-restricted access
- **Deployment Verification**: Every deployment includes automated health checks and error
  monitoring validation
- **Failure Handling**: Automated rollback procedures triggered by workflow failure detection

- **Live Monitoring (MANDATORY)**: All Deploy workflows (Preview and Production) MUST be actively
  monitored using the official GitHub Actions VS Code extension. The responsible engineer keeps the
  workflow run view open, follows logs until completion, verifies the final status, reviews
  artifacts (e.g., Playwright report), and captures the deployment URL when applicable. Failure to
  monitor constitutes a process violation.

## Governance

### Constitution Enforcement

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and must be followed strictly:

- **PR Reviews**: All pull requests must verify constitutional compliance including deployment
  workflow adherence

  GitHub Actions exclusively
- **Deployment Compliance**: Manual deployments are constitutional violations and must be
  immediately reported and reversed
- **Workflow Monitoring**: All deployment activities are logged and audited through GitHub Actions
  for compliance verification
- **Exception Process**: Any deviation requires explicit justification and team approval - NO
  exceptions for deployment workflow bypass
- **Regular Audits**: Monthly reviews of compliance and process effectiveness including deployment
  workflow adherence

### Amendment Process

- **Documentation Required**: All changes must be documented with clear rationale
- **Team Approval**: Constitutional changes require unanimous team agreement
- **Migration Plan**: Breaking changes need detailed migration and rollback strategies
- **Version Control**: All amendments are tracked with proper versioning

### Testing Compliance

- **Unit Test Mandate**: No feature implementation without corresponding unit tests
- **Prettier Compliance**: All code must pass `npm run test:prettier` validation
